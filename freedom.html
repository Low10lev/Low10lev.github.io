          <strong>
            Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.

          <strong>
            The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experiences of the past, good experiences of the past, fears and anxieties
            about the future, ambitions for the future, clinging tompresent things, and delusions about our own importance.
          </strong>

      <hr>
          <strong>
            You can never truly achieve freedom until you have watched anime with chips and salsa for a whole 24 hours without worry, cause
            life sucks and I need my escape.
