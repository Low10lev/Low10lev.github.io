            Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.

          <strong>
            The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experiences of the past, good experiences of
              <br>
            the past, fears and anxieties about the future, ambitions for the future, clinging tompresent things,
              <br>
            and delusions about our own importance.

            You can never truly achieve true freedom until you have watched anime with chips and salsa for a whole 24 hours without worry, cause
            life sucks and I need my escape.
